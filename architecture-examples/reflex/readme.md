# [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) using Reflex

Reflex is a reactive programming approach to creating web applications.

Reflex allows you to react to, filter and transform live streams of data in
real time.

## Install

You'll need [Node][node] with [NPM][npm]. Once you've got that:

```sh
cd todomvc/architecture-examples/reflex
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
cd todomvc/architecture-examples/reflex
npm run browserify
```

Open `index.html` in your browser. You don't need a local server.
